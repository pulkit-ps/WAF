Configuring the web application -   
  We host our reverse proxy on default port 80 and web server on port 8008. You can configure these port values in Constant.py file of reverse proxy.  var - WEB_HOST_PORT for web server port and RP_PORT for reverse proxy port.

  Now you need to protect port 8008 from direct access, that can be done using ufw (sudo ufw deny 8008). 
  
  start web server
  Run the file proxyserver.py with one of the following command line arguments -
  e.g. sudo python proxyserver.py "start_train" this will start the reverse proxy on port 80 in train mode.
           start_train - To run the reverse proxy  in training mode.
           start_test - To run the reverse proxy in testing mode.
           reset - To reset the training data .    
  After surfing the website , stop and restart the reverse proxy in testing mode.    

  To modify the blacklist of signatures, add your string in file blacklistExp.py.
  We have also attached a sample tester website on which this reverseproxy can be tested upon.
